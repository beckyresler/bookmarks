# Bookmarks Web App

This is a web application for managing and displaying frequently accessed websites ... aka bookmarks.


## Background

Quite a while back, I set up a static HTML file containing groups of links that I regularly visit. I like having a page with all of the links on it better than searching through the bookmarks in my browser.

I set this static file as the "home page" for my browser. The file lives in my Dropbox folder so that I can have it available on my work computer.

This has worked well for me, but updating the file is clunky. Also, I haven't figured out how to load the file in my mobile browser.

I decided to develop this application to make managing my links easier and to make the links available on any device that I need them on.

This application uses the following packages, library, technology, etc.

* [Laravel framework](https://laravel.com/docs/6.x/) - version 6.x
